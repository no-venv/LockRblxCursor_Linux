# LockRblxCursor_Linux

Python script to lock your cursor on waydroid sessions

This only works on X window clients, I don't know how to get the window geometry universally on wayland desktops

As a result, install `weston` for your distro and run waydroid through there. Then run the script on the weston window.

# Dependencies

- pynput
- xdotool

# Install

If you have git installed, you can run:
`git clone https://github.com/no-venv/LockRblxCursor_Linux` 

to clone this git repository or download this as a zip.
